# FCC Bot Tracking

## This is not a data science presentation

- I'm not a data scientist |

- I used some pretty simple tools |

- Boy howdy, I am bad at Pandas |

Note:
Most people in this room could do something similar.
I am no genius.

---

## More Disclaimers

- My data isn't fully up-to-date |

- This data is messy |

- I will be hand-waving some complexities |

- Would love to answer questions after, if you'd like to know more |

Note:
I spent a ton of time looking into this, and I am distilling my findings. I'm not done yet.

## What is this FCC issue?

- The head of the FCC wants to roll back Title II regulations on ISPs |

- Most tech people do not support this |

- Most ISPs would very much like this proposal to succeed |

Note:
Check out John Oliver's segment
---

## Public Comments?

- Any time the FCC has a proposal, they solicit public comments |

- Comments are not an actual vote |

- Public sentiment has helped sway things before |

- Comments are submitted via web form, API or CSV |

Note:
Comments are supposed to be legal arguments. In 2014, they were very important to show public sentiment
---

## The FCC has a Comment API!

- Returns JSON |

- With an API key, allows posting of comments |

- Drives the FCC frontend |

Note:
There's a restricted API, and one that drives the website
Went down for a bit, claimed DDOS
---

# Let's look at the JSON!

---?code=my-comment.json&lang=json

@[2](Every comment has a unique ID)
@[19-25](Address isn't required, but it's often present)
@[26](Email isn't visible on the web frontend, but it's available in the API)
@[35-36](These dates are effectively the same)
@[37](This is the date the comment was approved and posted to the website)
@[99](The comment itself)
@[43]
@[57]
@[101]
@[102]

---
## Tools

- I used Elasticsearch as a data store |

- Crawled the API, and and indexed ES with Python |

- Had a separate Python process to analyze comments |

- Used Kibana for a lot of the slicing and dicing |

---

## Tagging

- Grouping by "source" |

- Was there a full physical address? |

- Where did the comment come from? (Web, CSV, API) |

Note:
Talk about index vs analyze

# Bot #1: "Unprecedented"

+++

> The unprecedented regulatory power the Obama Administration imposed on the internet is smothering innovation, damaging the American economy and obstructing job creation. I urge the Federal Communications Commission to end the bureaucratic regulatory overreach of the internet known as Title II and restore the bipartisan light-touch regulatory consensus that enabled the internet to flourish for more than 20 years...

## Commonalities

# Bot #2: "Free our internet"

+++

> In 2015, President Obama's FCC passed rules treating the Internet as a government regulated public utility for the first time in history. Those pushing hardest for the new rules were Silicon Valley monopolies like Google and leftist globalists like George Soros...
>...
>...I strongly encourage the FCC to oppose efforts by the TechLeft and liberal globalists to take over our Internet. Please roll back President Obama's disastrous rules immediately. The future of a free and open Internet is at stake.

# Bot #3 "Taxpayers Protection Alliance"

+++

> Obama's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced regulations on the internet that put the government, and unaccountable bureaucrats, in control. These rules have cost taxpayers, slowed down broadband infrastructure investment, and hindered competition and choice for Americans. The time to remove the regulatory stranglehold on the internet is NOW...

# Bot #4 "Recursion"

Note:
This one popped up AFTER my post

+++

<pre>Dear Commissioners: Regarding Net Neutrality and Title II.
I want to implore the Federal Communications Commission to reverse Obama's decision to take over broadband.
Individuals, rather than unelected bureaucrats, should buy whichever products we desire. Obama's decision to take over broadband is a exploitation of the open Internet.
It reversed a free-market system that performed exceptionally successfully for many years with bipartisan approval.</pre>

<pre>To the FCC: I am a voter worried about restoring Internet freedom.
I strongly suggest the FCC to undo Barack Obama's decision to regulate the web.
Individuals, not unelected bureaucrats, should buy which products we desire.
Barack Obama's decision to regulate the web is a distortion of the open Internet.
It stopped a free-market framework that performed exceptionally successfully for two decades with nearly universal consensus.</pre>

<pre>Dear Mr. Pai, In reference to Title II rules.
I'd like to advocate the government to overturn President Obama's decision to take over the Internet.
Individuals, not so-called experts, should be free to use whatever services they prefer.
President Obama's decision to take over the Internet is a distortion of the open Internet.
It broke a market-based framework that performed fabulously successfully for two decades with broad bipartisan support.</pre>

# Why do I think these are bots?

+++

## The comment rates are...suspicious

- A lot of "flat" rates |

- Many blank spots |

- Unnatural distributions when compared to other sources |

+++

## The data is too good

- The addresses are full, and well formatted |

- No obviously fake emails, addresses |

- Almost no one submitting multiple times |
Note:
When you have a web form, people submit it multiple times
People don't like putting their information into forms, you get a lot of "Fake McFakerson's"
+++

## There are a lot of "breached" accounts

Breaches only include physical addresses
+++

## These aren't "visible" campaigns

- These aren't organizations with a ton of twitter followers |

- They aren't obviously getting traction online |

- For some of these, no one knows where the form lives |

## We asked a bunch of the submitters

## So, what is the FCC gonna do about the bots?

Probably nothing.

Note:
The FCC has said that they can't police these comments
They also claimed that they werre DDOS'ed
